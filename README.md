# Tweeter

This project created a Heroku app to interact with Twitter. The script creates a function that gets the weather in Washington, D.C. and Tweets it.
* Construct a Query URL for the OpenWeatherMap
* Perform the API call to get the weather
* Set up your Twitter credentials
* Tweet the weather
* Print the success message 
* Set timer to run every 1 minute (for your Heroku app)
